# confInventory
confInventory is a configurable inventory I made for the sake of making it.
I never made an inventory system by my own before so this will do.
Weapons/items must be added to the config before they can be used inside the inventory.
This only works on darkrp or darkrp derived gamemodes but if someone wants
a sandbox version I might consider adding the compatibility for it.

**Features include:**
* a whitelist for weapons/entities that can be picked up & added directly to the players weapon table or other
* a way to store item externaly in a storage crate
* 2 skills that prevent players from using certain items/weapons if they dont meet the skill requirement (hardcoded)
* slots for player inventory & storage crate
* some other stuff that I cant think of right now

**Known bugs:**
* weapons with no ammo will cause errors but wont break anything
